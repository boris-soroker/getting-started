"Sameroom fully supports file sharing with the following providers: Campfire, HipChat, Slack, and Flowdock.

In other words, if you use HipChat and work with a team on Flowdock, all files posted by the Flowdock team will be uploaded to your HipChat team account. You get to keep your copies even if the Flowdock team account is deleted. 

If the other team uses Kato, their files will appear as S3 links. These links cannot be deleted, so you'll always have access. (Your files will be uploaded to Kato and become S3 links.)

Gitter and IRC don't have built-in file sharing functionality at all—the only way to share a file is by posting a link. 

Therefore, if you use Gitter or IRC, and someone shares a file with you from another team, Sameroom will use its internal file storage, where files ONLY LIVE FOR 24 HOURS.

The same currently applies to email—if you connect to a Portal with an email account, files shared with you will appear as links that live for 24 hours (we will improve this soon).

If you want to use email to send files, just use attachments—these will be shared with the other team in a way that is supported by the other team's provider."
