This guide shows you how to connect a channel in Slack to a flow in Flowdock.

You can also start by connecting a Flowdock Flow to a Slack channel; the process for this is exactly the same.

1. Before you proceed, ensure you have authorized Sameroom with both your Slack and Flowdock accounts.

2. Once you've logged it, click on the <a href="https://sameroom.io/open-a-tube" target="_blank">Open a Tube</a> link![Sameroom Opening a Tube](https://in.kato.im/e021132e67acf994d191a885ced37b56ca5155564db4a5d9d30146245ce6252/Sameroom%20Open%20Tube.png)
