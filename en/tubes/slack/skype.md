This guide shows you how to connect a channel in Slack to a conversation in Skype. 

You can also start by connecting a Skype conversation to a Slack channel; the process for this is exactly the same.

1. Before you proceed, ensure you have authorized Sameroom with both your Slack and Skype accounts.

2. Once you've logged it, click on the <a href="https://sameroom.io/open-a-tube" target="_blank">Open a Tube</a> link![Sameroom Opening a Tube](https://in.kato.im/e021132e67acf994d191a885ced37b56ca5155564db4a5d9d30146245ce6252/Sameroom%20Open%20Tube.png)


3. Type the name of the Slack channel (or Skype conversation) you’d like to connect from and select it in the dropdown menu
