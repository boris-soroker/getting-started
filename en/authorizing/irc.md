Authorizing Sameroom with IRC
---

####Note: We have optimized Sameroom to work with Freenode. The experience with other networks may varyâ€”please let us know if you're experiencing any issues.

To register your nick on Freenode, connect to the network and issue the following:

`/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com`

To learn more, please consult the [Freenode FAQ](https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering).

Sameroom will only let you connect registered channels. For example, to register a channel "#foo", follow these steps:

`/join #foo`

`/msg ChanServ register #foo`

Once you've logged into your IRC account, you can either; connect two chat teams by [creating a Tube](/getting-started/en/tubes-portals/tubes) or, share a channel via a [Portal URL](/getting-started/en/tubes-portals/portals).
