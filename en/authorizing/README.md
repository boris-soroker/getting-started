## Authorizing Your Chat Platform

This section outlines the first step in getting started with Sameroom. You'll need to authorize Sameroom to integrate with your chat platform. If you are a member of two or more chat teams, pick one platform to authorize first and you can [add more platforms](/getting-started/en/add-account/readme.md) to your account later.

Click on your platform below and follow the instructions on the page to authorize Sameroom.
