####A Portal URL will allow you to connect to a channel or room on the senders chat team with your Flowdock account. 

#####Go to the Portal URL youâ€™ve received. The URL looks something like this `https://sameroom.io/98IX89`

#####Click on the Flowdock logo

#####Select a Flow from the dropdown menu (This is where messages from the Portal will be shown). You can also create a new Flow in Flowdock and refresh the list
