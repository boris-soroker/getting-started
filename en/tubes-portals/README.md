There are two ways to connect channels or rooms between chat teams. 

If you have access to both chat teams and would like to create a direct connection between two chat rooms or channels, we suggest creating a Tube.

If you would like to invite many users at once to your channel or chat room, we suggest creating a Portal URL. This will allow users with the URL to create a Tube to your channel or chat room.
