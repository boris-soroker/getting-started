There are two ways to connect channels or rooms between chat teams. 

If you have access to both chat teams and would like to create a direct connection between two chat rooms or channels, we suggest [creating a Tube](/getting-started/en/tubes-portals/tubes).

If you would like to invite many users at once to your channel or chat room, we suggest [creating a Portal](/getting-started/en/tubes-portals/portals). This will allow users with the URL to [create a Tube](/getting-started/en/tubes-portals/tubes) to your channel or chat room.
