If you want to connect rooms from different chat platforms (for example, **Slack** and **HipChat**), [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io) can help. 

We will use names **A** and **B** for rooms you would like to connect.

There are two basic scenarios:

### ![step-1.png](https://in.kato.im/b8be284b81c9467fed3170d274c28de6789dd2fae1957895cd34bc20a2676d25/step-1.png) &ensp; **You create a Tube**
 
In that scenario, you have access to both rooms, **A** and **B**, you would like to connect. In our example, it means you have access to a channel from a **Slack** team and a room from a **HipChat** team.  

So, to connect rooms **A** and **B**, you just create in Sameroom a Tube between **A** and **B** [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube). After that, messages posted in room **A** will be releyed by Sameroom to room **B**, and messages posted in room **B** will be releyed by Sameroom to room **A** [[see details]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).

### ![step-2.png](https://in.kato.im/99977b264e016814f4af35ac12a7fe42f1138758cd4b9285fa8c34e628a264fd/step-2.png) &ensp; **You create a Portal used by your counterpart to create a Tube**
 
In that scenario, you have access only to one of the rooms you would like to connect (say, room **A**), and you know somebody who has access to the second room (room **B**), your _counterpart_.

First, you create in Sameroom a Portal for the room **A** [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-use-a-portal).

Then, you send that Portal (which is just a URL) to your counterpart.

Finally, your counterpart creates in Sameroom a Tube between your Portal for the room **A** and the room **B** [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube). After that, again, messages posted in room **A** will be releyed by Sameroom to room **B**, and messages posted in room **B** will be releyed by Sameroom to room **A** [[see details]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).
