If you want to connect rooms from different chat platforms (for example, **Slack** and **HipChat**), [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io) can help.

There are two basic scenarios:

If you have access to both rooms you would like to connect (in our example, it means access to rooms, or channels, from a **Slack** team and a **HipChat** team), you can just create a Tube between those two rooms in Sameroom [see how](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).

If you have access only to one of the rooms you would like to connect, you can create a Portal first (it is just a URL) [see how](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-use-a-portal), and then send it to somebody who has access to the desired second room. Then, that "somebody" will create a Tube between the Portal (your room) and the second room [see how](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).
