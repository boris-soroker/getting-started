If you want to connect rooms from different chat platforms (for example, **Slack** and **HipChat**), [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io) can help.

There are two basic scenarios:

### ![step-1.png](https://in.kato.im/b8be284b81c9467fed3170d274c28de6789dd2fae1957895cd34bc20a2676d25/step-1.png) &ensp; **Scenario 1: You create a Tube**
 
If you have access to both rooms you would like to connect (in our example, it means access to rooms, or channels, from a **Slack** team and a **HipChat** team), you can just create a Tube between those two rooms in Sameroom [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).

If you have access only to one of the rooms you would like to connect, you can create a Portal first [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-use-a-portal), send that Portal URL to your counterpart (i.e. somebody who has access to the desired second room), and that counterpart will create a Tube between the Portal (your room) and the second room [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).
