There are two basic scenarios:

If you have access to both rooms you would like to connect, you can just create a Tube between them in Sameroom [see how](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).

If you have access only to one of the rooms you would like to connect, you can create a Portal and send it to somebody who has access to the second rooms [see how](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-use-a-portal).
