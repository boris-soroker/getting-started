If you want to connect rooms from different chat platforms (for example, **Slack** and **HipChat**), [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io) can help. 

We will use symbolic names **A** and **B** for rooms YOU would like to connect.

There are two basic scenarios:

### ![step-1.png](https://in.kato.im/b8be284b81c9467fed3170d274c28de6789dd2fae1957895cd34bc20a2676d25/step-1.png) &ensp; **You create a Tube**
 
If you have access to both rooms you would like to connect (in our example, it means access to rooms, or channels, from a **Slack** team and a **HipChat** team), you can just create in Sameroom a Tube between those two rooms in Sameroom [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube). After that, messages posted in **A** will be releyed by Sameroom to **B**, and messages posted in **B** will be releyed by Sameroom to **A** [[see details]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).

### ![step-2.png](https://in.kato.im/99977b264e016814f4af35ac12a7fe42f1138758cd4b9285fa8c34e628a264fd/step-2.png) &ensp; **You create a Portal used by your counterpart to create a Tube**
 
If you have access only to one of the rooms you would like to connect, you can create in Sameroom a Portal for that room first [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-use-a-portal), send that Portal to your counterpart (i.e. somebody who has access to the desired second room), and that counterpart will create in Sameroom a Tube between the Portal (your room) and the second room [[see how]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube). After that, again, messages posted in **A** will be releyed by Sameroom to **B**, and messages posted in **B** will be releyed by Sameroom to **A** [[see details]](/getting-started/en/faq/list#how-to-create-a-tube).
